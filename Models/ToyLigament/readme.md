# Notes of the Toy Knee Ligment model

## General
The purpose of this model is to have an simple example of a model with ligaments that we can distribute and (potentially) use in example or testing.

## Model discription
This model uses the Leg39.osim as a base and adds ligaments defined by Hang., et al, (2014). The SimTK project for the full knee ligament model is here;
